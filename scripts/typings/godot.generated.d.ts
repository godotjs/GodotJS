If the signal is already connected, this method returns [constant ERR_INVALID_PARAMETER] and pushes an error message, unless the signal is connected with [constant CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED]. To prevent this, use [method is_connected] first to check for existing connections.
         *  If the [param callable]'s object is freed, the connection will be lost.
         *  **Examples with recommended syntax:**
         *  Connecting signals is one of the most common operations in Godot and the API gives many options to do so, which are described further down. The code block below shows the recommended approach.
         *
         *  **[code skip-lint]Object.connect()` or [code skip-lint]Signal.connect()`?**
         *  As seen above, the recommended method to connect signals is not [method Object.connect]. The code block below shows the four options for connecting signals, using either this legacy method or the recommended [method Signal.connect], and using either an implicit [Callable] or a manually defined one.
         *
         *  While all options have the same outcome (`button`'s [signal BaseButton.button_down] signal will be connected to `_on_button_down`), **option 3** offers the best validation: it will print a compile-time error if either the `button_down` [Signal] or the `_on_button_down` [Callable] are not defined. On the other hand, **option 2** only relies on string names and will only be able to validate either names at runtime: it will print a runtime error if `"button_down"` doesn't correspond to a signal, or if `"_on_button_down"` is not a registered method in the object `self`. The main reason for using options 1, 2, or 4 would be if you actually need to use strings (e.g. to connect signals programmatically based on strings read from a configuration file). Otherwise, option 3 is the recommended (and fastest) method.
         *  **Binding and passing parameters:**
         *  The syntax to bind parameters is through [method Callable.bind], which returns a copy of the [Callable] with its parameters bound.
         *  When calling [method emit_signal] or [method Signal.emit], the signal parameters can be also passed. The examples below show the relationship between these signal parameters and bound parameters.
